      <p>
		In this assignment, we used C++ to build a simple rasterizer that features triangle-drawing, supersampling, hierarchical transforms, and various texture mapping methods. It was incredibly fascinating to explore the various ways that images are rendered, as well as comparing the different sampling/anti-aliasing configurations.

    <h2 align="left">Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>

    <h3>Triangle Rasterization Process</h3>
    <p>The triangle rasterization process is handled through the use of two functions: <code> rasterize_triangle</code> and <code>insideCheck</code>.</p>
    <dl>
      <code> rasterize_triangle </code>
          <ol>
            <li><code> rasterize_triangle</code> first finds the bounding box of the triangle based on the three inputted points.
              It does this by finding the smallest \(x,y\) values and largest \(x,y\) values, making sure to use <code>floor</code> 
              for the lower bound and <code>ceil</code> for the upperbound. This step is important to ensure that even if a
               vertex is only partially covered by a pixel, it is still considered when rendering by the bounding box.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li><code> rasterize_triangle</code> then uses a nested for loop (over \(i, j\)) to iterate over the entire bounding box, where it
               makes calls to <code>inside_check</code> with the pixel's position +0.5 in either direction in order to verify whether each pixel in the bounding box is within the
                triangle. This offset is to measure from the middle of the pixel rather than corner. If the pixel is within the triangle, then it is added to the sample buffer. </li>

            <br />
            <li>If the pixel is inside, the <code>fill_pixel</code> function is called and the \(i,j\) position on the board is filled with that color. 

              <br>
              
              
            </li>
          </ol>
      <code>inside_check</code>
      <br\>
        <blockquote> <pre>bool insideCheck(double x0, double y0, double x1, double y1, double x2,
                 double y2, double x, double y) {
  double line1 = -(x - x0) * (y1 - y0) + (y - y0) * (x1 - x0);
  double line2 = -(x - x1) * (y2 - y1) + (y - y1) * (x2 - x1);
  double line3 = -(x - x2) * (y0 - y2) + (y - y2) * (x0 - x2);

  return (line1 >= 0 && line2 >= 0 && line3 >= 0) ||
         (line1 <= 0 && line2 <= 0 && line3 <= 0);
}</pre></blockquote></dd>
      <ol>
        <li> <code>inside_check</code> first computes the line equations presented in lecture from the lines formed by \(v_0 \to v_1\), \(v_1 \to v_2\), and \(v_2 \to v_0\).
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Then, a final check must be done to ensure that the point is on the correct side of each halfspace, meaning it is inside the triangle. </li>
      </ol>
    </dl>
    


    <h3>Algorithmic Efficiency</h3>
    <p>Since the described process only iterates through every pixel in the bounding box once, it exactly matches the efficency of an alg that only samples each pixel one time. It has efficiency \(O(WH)\) where \(W\) is width and \(H\) is height.</p>

    <h3>Example of Basic Rasterization with Aliasing</h3>
    <div align="middle">
      <table style="width: 100%">
        <tr align="center">
          <td>
            <img src="images/test4render.png" align="middle" width="300vw" />
            <figcaption>Test 4 with Default Params Demonstrating Aliasing.</figcaption>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p>Using the basic rasterization process described in class without any supersampling, aliasing in the form of gaps in the triangle rendering can be seen. Here, the gap is located on the left corner of the red triangle.</p>

  <h2 align="left">Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
  
  <p>The triangle supersampling process is handled through the use of two functions: a modification to <code> rasterize_triangle</code> and <code>resolve_to_framebuffer.</code></p>

  <h3>Triangle Supersampling Process</h3>
  <dl>
    <code> rasterize_triangle </code>
        <ol>
          <li>Inside the existing nested for loop that traverses each pixel in the original screen, the following code snippet was added to perform supersamples of each pixel:
            <blockquote><pre>
for (int k = 0; k < sqrt(sample_rate); k++) {
  for (int l = 0; l < sqrt(sample_rate); l++) {
    double x_point;
    double y_point;

    // find the proper sampling distance
    if (sample_rate > 1) {
      x_point = i + (1 + l * 2) * (1 / (sqrt(sample_rate) * 2));
      y_point = j + (1 + k * 2) * (1 / (sqrt(sample_rate) * 2));
    } else {
      // if sample rate = 1
      x_point = i + 0.5;
      y_point = j + 0.5;
    }

    if (insideCheck(x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2, x_point, y_point)) {
      // code for offsetting the buffer pixel input
      this->sample_buffer[width * j * sample_rate + i * sample_rate +
                          k * sqrt(sample_rate) + l] = color;
    }
  }
}</pre>
            </blockquote>
            Another nested for loop was used to iterate <code>sqrt(sample_rate)</code> times each to properly supersample at <code>sample_rate</code>; for example, a rate of 16 corresponds to a 4x4 square of samples, or <code>sqrt(sample_rate) * sqrt(sample_rate)</code> grid. 
            Then, to calcuate where inside the pixel each sample should be taken, the <code>x_point</code> and <code>y_point</code> logic were defined as such. Following the lecture slides, the formula was calculated such that each sample lies at 
            the center of the subdivided pixel grid. During implementation, <code>x_point</code> and <code>y_point</code> actually had to be changed from floats to doubles to account for rounding errors not rendering smaller triangles.
            <br>
            <br>
            When inserting pixel samples into the <code>sample_buffer</code>, the positioning of each pixel had to be offset to insert a 
            2D position into 1D array. The following logic, then, was used to group all supersamples of each pixel together, 
            which is diagrammed below. This leads to the required offsets on \(i,j,k,l\) shown in the code above to properly index samples.
            <div align="middle">
              <table style="width: 100%">

            </div>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>Due to the changes performed in <code>rasterize_triangle</code>, <code>resolve_to_framebuffer</code> also had to be modified in order to properly take the upsampled pixels and the downsample them again with corresponding opacity values. </li>

          <br />
        </ol>
    <dt>resolve_to_framebuffer</dt>
    <dd> Resolve to framebuffer needs to be modified in order to handle the larger frame_buffer data structure that contains supersampled results. <br>
    <ol>
      <li> Firstly, the loop logic to collect samples is copied, but the inner l,k loops are used to collect all samples for a pixel to be averaged out.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li> Here, the <code>derived_color</code> variable is initialized to have RGB channels all 0, which are then proprotionally added back to as all samples are collected. (Aka, derived color is an average of all sample colors)</li>
      <blockquote><pre>
Color derivedCol = Color();

for (int off1 = 0; off1 < sqrt(sample_rate); off1++) {
  for (int off2 = 0; off2 < sqrt(sample_rate); off2++) {
    Color c = this->sample_buffer[width * y * sample_rate + x * sample_rate +
                                  off1 * sqrt(sample_rate) + off2];
  
    derivedCol += 1.0/sample_rate * c; 
  }
}</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <li>Finally, the derived color is written to the <code>rgb_framebuffer_target</code> using the already implemented method.</li>
    </ol>
    <code>clear_buffers</code>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <dd> The <code>clear_buffers</code> commands was added into the <code>set_sample_rate</code> and <code>set_framebuffer_target</code> functions in order to make sure the framebuffer was empty everytime it needed to be overwritten with a new render (when more supersamples are taken or window is resized). </dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>Supersampling Results</h3>
  <div align="left">

    </table>
  </div>

  <p> These results are observed because increasing the supersampling rate means the pixel color value better 
    represents the proportion of the pixel covered by the triangle. In general, supersampling allows the 
    render to capture and display more information about the picture than if it was rendered at a lower resolution, even when it is downscaled.
    At rate 1, the rasterizer only considers if the middle of the pixel is within the triangle.
    This makes it more likely to discount certain pixels as not being in the triangle at all. Using supersampling, though, more subsamples within the 
    pixel would be categorized as inside the triangle, thus filling the gap seen in the top left image. In general, 
    supersampling helps to reduce aliasing, and increasing the rate would mean each pixel becomes a better characterization of how much of the pixel is contained in the triangle, which is reflected in the opacity of the pixel.

  <h2 align="left">Task 3: Transforms</h2>

  We transformed cubeman in <a href="https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Satoru_Gojo">Gojo Satoru</a>. See our results below:

  <h2 align="left">Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>

  <p>
	Barycentric coordinates are a way to represent a point in space in terms of a linear combination of a set of (3) points. 
	In the context of computer graphics, it's essentially taking the colors of a set of coordinates, and blending them together to form a hybrid color at a given coordinate; it's basically color interpolation! 
	In this class, we the barycentric coordinates of a 2D vector \((x, y)\) to be \((\alpha, \beta, \gamma)\), characterized in the figure below from lecture:
  </p>
  <div align="middle">
	<table style="width: 100%">

		  <img src="images/bc_diagram.png" align="middle" width="300vw" />
		  <!-- <figcaption>RGB Triangle.</figcaption> -->
		</td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
  </div>	
  <p>The barycentric coordinates add up to 1 to ensure that the color of the coordinate is representative of something "inside" of the colors of the 3 reference points. Another way to think about this is that we shouldn't be introducing more "color" than what we started with. We provide a visualization of the color blending in the RGB triangle below, in which we observe a smooth, natural blending of colors.
  </p>
  <div align="middle">
	<table style="width: 100%">
	  <tr align="center">

	  </tr>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <h2 align="left">Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>

  <p>
	Pixel sampling is the process of determining which texel to sample from based on the barycentric coordinates of the pixel in the image.
	To implement this, we multiply the barycentric coordinates by the dimensions of the texture image, and then interpolate the result based on the sampling method:
	<ol>
		<li><b>Nearest Sampling:</b> rounds result to the nearest integer.</li>
		<li><b>Bilinear Sampling:</b> perform three bilinear interpolations (<code>lerp</code>) in the \(u, v\) directions, within texture values corresponding to the bounds of a unit square containing the image pixel. </li>
	</ol> 
	In general, bilinear sampling yields better texture mappings compared to nearest sampling. We provide a clear example of bilinear sampling outperforming nearest sampling in the figure below:
</p>
	<div align="middle">
		<table style="width: 100%">
		  <tr align="center">
			<td>
			  <img src="images/pixel_sampling_nearest.png" align="middle" width="300vw" />
			</td>
			<td>
			  <img src="images/pixel_sampling_bilinear.png" align="middle" width="300vw" />
			</td>
		  </tr>
		</table>
		<figcaption>Pixel Inspection on <code>svg/texmap/test1.svg</code>.
		</figcaption>
	  </div>
	  <p>
	  We observe that bilinear sampling (right) yields a much smoother and less jaggy texture mapping compared to nearest sampling (left).
	The performance difference is likely most pronounced in line or edge texturing.
  </p>

  <h2 align="left">Task 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>

  <p>
	Level sampling is using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap">mipmaps</a> to sample the texture of an image at various "levels" or resolutions. 
	To implement this, we follow the procedure below:
	<ol>
		<li><b>Compute Mipmap Level:</b> scale the \(uv\) barycentric difference vectors up by the dimensions of the texture image, and then take the <code>log2</code> of the max of their norms. </li>
		<li><b>Sample:</b> for <code>L_ZERO</code>, we hardcode the level to be 0; for <code>L_NEAREST</code>, we round the level to the nearest integer; and for <code>L_LINEAR</code>, we sample based on the floor and ceiling of the level, and then linearly interpolate the resulting colors.</li>
	</ol>
	Now, we are able to adjust our sampling technique among <i>pixel sampling</i>, <i>level sampling</i>, or <i>the number of samples per pixel</i>. We describe some performance tradeoffs among these tuning methods:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Pixel Sampling:</b> good for general texture/perspective mapping, but fails on moire patterns and is weaker compared to super-sampling rasterization.</li>
<li><b>Level Sampling:</b> enables for dynamic balance between memory saving and time efficiency (i.e. balance between pixel sampling and super-sampling), also reduces moire patterns.</li>
<li><b>Number of Samples per Pixel:</b> tuning this parameter can fix moire patterns and general aliasing (better than pixel sampling or level sampling), but can be computationally heavy when perform high super-sampling.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We now apply various sampling methods on an image of Toji, an anime character. We provide the 6 versions of Toji below:
